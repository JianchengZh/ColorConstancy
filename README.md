Color Constancy Algorithms 
***

1. Overview 

    This project contains implementations of color constancy algorithms.
     This contains following algorithms:
    - Horn's algorithm [Horn 1974, 1986]
    - Blake's algorithm [Blake 1985]
    - Moore's algorithm [Moore 1991]
    - Rahman's algorithm [Rahman et al. 1991]
    - Homomorphic filtering [Stockham Jr. 1972]
  
    All of the codes are dependent on OpenCV 2.4 (maybe it
    will work with older varsions as well). Each folder named
    with aforementioned algorithm containes "main.cpp."
    These programes include header "clcnst.h" that is 
    in the folder named "clcnst".


1. Installation
    Please execute following command.

        $ make all
        $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:`pwd`/bin/
        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PAH
